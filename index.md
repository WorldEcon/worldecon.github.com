		splm is an R package for the estimation and testing of various spatial panel data specifications. We consider the implementation of both maximum likelihood and generalized moments estimators in the context of fixed as well as random effects spatial panel data models. This paper is a general description of splm and all functionalities are illustrated using a well-known example taken from Munnell (1990) with productivity data on 48 US states observed over 17 years. We perform comparisons with other available software; and, when this is not possible, Monte Carlo results support our original implementation.

或者是写一些自己的心得:

	Recent years have wittnessed a proliferation of literatures and discussions about the effect of foreign direct investment to Chinese environment, however these studies mainly focus on the sheer quantity of pollution which caused by the foreign direct investments in China, and there is little paper that explore the interaction between foreign direct investments and a sound and fast development of China with the idea of sustainability and consistency of economics advancement, resource and environment. For a start, This paper use DEA to calculate "Regional ecological efficiency" as a index to measure the sustainability of Chinese provincial development. Then we use Tobit model with Chinese provincial panel data to test the affect of foreign direct investment to Regional ecological efficiency. The result of regressions found that foreign direct investments will exert a positive influence on regional ecological efficiency in China, yet primarily among the eastern provinces.
